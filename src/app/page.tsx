        SciGraph API is already complete - you can check my GitHub; I just have
        to add procfiles on Heroku to start the server and hook it up here on
        the frontend with Stripe API integrated. The home page and contact page
        will be styled once I have the time to. I am quite busy now so those
        will have to wait for another 2 weeks. I am planning to have first few
        hours free based on visitor IP address, and then rest of it charged just
        to cover server costs. Probably about 5 dollars per month for eco dynos.
        Some classic web games will be coming up soon, including but not limited
        to: Tetris, PacMan, Space Invaders, Chess, 8 Ball Pool.
